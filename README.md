# GIFOS

This is an interactive web application to share animated GIFs based on a practise exercise from a Udemy course I'm taking ([React: De cero a experto ( Hooks y MERN )](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-cero-experto)) combined with the project's mock-up from another course I took, the Web Full Stack Development intensive programme by Ac√°mica.
